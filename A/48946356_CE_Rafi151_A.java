It seems like you're providing a problem statement and a sample input-output pair for a coding challenge. The problem is asking you to find a certain integer \( k \) based on the given input integer \( n \). To solve it in Java, you can use a simple loop or a mathematical formula, depending on the pattern of the output.

Here's a Java solution using a loop to find the required integer \( k \) based on the input \( n \):

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = scanner.nextInt(); // Number of test cases

        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
            int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Input integer
            int k = findK(n); // Function to find k
            System.out.println(k); // Output k
        }
    }

    // Function to find k based on the given input n
    private static int findK(int n) {
        int k = 1;
        while (k <= n) {
            k *= 2;
        }
        return k / 2;
    }
}
```

This code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the input integer \( n \), finds the required integer \( k \) using the `findK` function, and prints the result.

The `findK` function finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( n \), which is essentially the largest \( k \) such that \( 2^k \leq n \).
